### Welcome to Iridium!

Iridium is a search engine built in Python, proposed as a final project in the DCC204 - Programming and Software Development II class at UFMG.
You can find the original proposition for the project in a pdf stored in the repository. It is in portuguese though!

Some references and inspirations taken in the development process.
