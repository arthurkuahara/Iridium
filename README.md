### Iridium

Iridium is a search engine built in Python, proposed as a final project in the DCC204 - Programming and Software Development II class at UFMG.
You can find the original proposition for the project in a PDF file stored in the repository. It is in portuguese though!

You can also find the specification of the project in the 'Documentacao.pdf' document (also in portuguese)

Some references and inspirations taken in the development process.
